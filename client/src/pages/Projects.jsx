                <li>Your article must be <strong>1000+ words</strong> and offer something valuable to our readers.</li>
                <li>You can only have <strong>1 self-serving link</strong>. Either a link to a relevant, informative, resource (i.e. a blog post) in the body of the article (dofollow link) or to your site or to any social media channel in the author bio (dofollow link). You can link to other relevant articles from the Creately blog that may add value to the article. But please refrain from excessive linking. In general, itâ€™s best to keep the link count under 5.</li>
                <li>Outgoing links must be <strong>relevant to our blog</strong>. For example, linking to dating sites, SEO agencies, Credit-related sites, etc. arenâ€™t allowed.</li>
                <li>Once published on our blog you cannot publish it anywhere else, including your own blog.</li>
                <li><strong>Images and videos</strong> are encouraged, as they make the article look further enticing to the reader. <strong>Images width should be 580 pixels or less</strong>. Please send them as a separate attachment. Make sure not to violate copyright when using images. Give credit when needed. If youâ€™re including technical diagrams like flowcharts, Gantt charts use the ones found in our diagram community.</li>
